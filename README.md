![Blackjack Game GIF: GIF_PLACEHOLDER](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=15iXCf9KUW1qlfClOm-il84T1B9zWK-Co&export=download) This Python program lets you play a classic Blackjack game against the dealer. It provides a basic simulation with clear instructions and informative messages.

**Features:**

- **Core Blackjack gameplay:** Deal cards, hit or stand, and aim for a hand total closest to 21 without going bust.
- **User-friendly interface:** Easy-to-follow prompts guide you through the game.
- **Simple hitting strategy:** The dealer follows a pre-defined logic to ensure a consistent game.

**How to Play:**

1. **Run the program:** Save the Python code as `blackjack.py` and execute it from your terminal using `python blackjack.py`.
2. **Follow the prompts:** The game will guide you through placing bets (optional), receiving cards, and making decisions on whether to hit or stand.
3. **Aim for 21:** Get your hand total as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it (busting).

**Note:**

- This is a basic simulation and doesn't account for all Blackjack nuances.
- The dealer's hitting strategy is simple and doesn't adapt dynamically (a complex task).

**Feel free to customize the code:**

- Explore implementing different betting systems.
- Try introducing more sophisticated hitting strategies for the dealer (consider computational complexity).
- Enhance the user interface with visuals.

Have fun playing and learning about Blackjack!
